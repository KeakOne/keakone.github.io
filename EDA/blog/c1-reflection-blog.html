  <em>Whats your take on the EDA experience?</em>
  <p>It is a much different learning enviroment than i am used to, but i like the idea of being more team-focused than focusing on learning independantly, and mostly ignoring where other students are. Being able to teach people a skill is a definant sign that you know it, so its good we will have the oppurtunity to help each other.</p>

  <em>What are your impressions?</em>
  <p>That if you are willing to truly apply yourself, and not hold back in becoming involved you will gve yourself the best outcome possible.</p>

  <em>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</em>
  <p>I can see myself taking a while to adjust, previously i've been more of an independant worker. I'm happy to have cohorts I know i can ask questions to at any time.</p>

  <em>Have your expectations of EDA changed?</em>
  <p>No, I knew before enrolling EDA had a very different education style & workflow.</p>

  <em>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning enviroment? does it make you nervous?</em>
  <p>Yes i am excited, it seems like the best preparation for the work enviroment as its very similiar.Im not too nervous just excited!</p>
