          <h5><em>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</em></h5>
          <p>By keeping the 'process over product' in mind, i tried to think about 'future-proofing' my site, so that in the future when i add more blogs it wont break the layout of the site. I also decided to draw multiple simple wireframes so i can make sure to choose the right one.</p>

          <h5><em>What did you think about mediation before reading chapter 2?</em></h5>
          <p>Before reading chapter 2 i was pretty open to the idea of meditation, but had never looked into the scientific facts that prove its worth, I had also always thought it was something that required a lot more training that just being able to focus your attention e.g you need to go to classes.</p>

          <h5><em> What new things have you learnt about mediation?</em></h5>
          <p>I learnt the idea that 'meditation is exercise for the brain', and that in all forms of training it is meeting resistance that builds strength. I've always thought that meditation was something that you cant measure or take steps at to be good at it, but you definaty can!

            The most interesting thing I learnt was that when you are completely calm that you are happy; happiness isnt something you can pursue, it just naturally happens when you are relaxed.</p>

          <h5><em> Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</em></h5>
          <p>I found the technique of sitting in the seven-point stance, looking downwards with my eyes very-slightly open, focusing on the ground in front of my feet was the most succesfull way to be alert and calm at the same time, while also stopping myself from becoming visually distracted.</p>

          <h5><em> Any other musings?</em></h5>
          <p>I'm quite suprised at how easy and quickly i've started practising mindfullness meditation, It's good to have this included in the course.</p>
