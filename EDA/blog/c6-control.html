        <em> What learnings did you take from the chapter?</em>
          <p<>The most interesting aspect of the chapter about self-regulation was the idea of "writing on water", that it is impossible to block your feelings from occuring, but with lots of practise its possible to let your emotions dissapate the moment you realise them. </p>

          <p>I also enjoyed the section about "practise of letting go", where the author talks about the difference between the physicality of pain and the phenomenon of pain, and to think of one as arising the other. I've tried to practise this with my legs after I injured myself over the weekend, just trying to distinguish between the physical pain i cannot control, and the parts i can control like paying attention to it.</p>

        <em>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</em>
          <p>I found it very beneficial to do after reading about new knowledge, in particular to try to focus on "feeling" the difference between my emotions, and my bodys reaction to emotions. After doing the excercise described in chapter 5, It made me feel more sure of what im learning, and that it will be good for me to be able to learn to deal with triggers.</p>

        <em>“If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment”</em>
