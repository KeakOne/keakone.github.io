        <em>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</em>
        <p>The best information i found for me about trust was reading the proof about trust being the 1# leading cause of dysfunction in a team enviroment. It made sense and it was an A-ha moment for me, as i had wondered what the main reason has been when i havnt reacted well to a course or teacher i've had.</p>

        <em>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</em>
        <p>I have found the listening excercises quite hard in the past but this one went well. Both my partner and I were very relaxed,it also helped i had been thinking about the loving-kindness excercise. I found that when she was talking about herself i was a lot more receptive to the emotions connected to the words. I was a lot more imaginitive with my interpretations of her talking, and also i wanted to listen more than talk.</p>

        <em>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</em>
        <p>I enjoyed it, it made me remember that everyone is very similiar and feel very empathetic towards the person i was thinking about, afterwards i wanted to call them and just check in on them! I want to try to do this excercise before i go to a crowded place or somewhere i will be talking to a lot of people.</p>

        <em>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing. Imagine a conflict-situation then Describe the situation as though you are 100 percent correct and reasonable, and then do the same for the opposite party of the situation.</em>
        <em>Part-1</em>
        <p>The situation was that an old friend of mine moved into our flat, and i had vouched for his placement with the other two flatmates. about a month into his tenancy he stopped payng rent and the other flatmates had decided they waned to kick him out. it was a hard situation for me because he is an old friend, but he was in the wrong by consensus of the flat.</p>

        <em>Part-2</em>
        <p>In this situation I moved into a flat when i first moved to wellington and had not found a job yet. I had told the existing flatmates i did not have a steady income except money saved.After a month I was offered a job oppurtunity in Christchurch that was very good and decided to take it. I left the flat and paid back all the money owed about a month later so it was sorted out eventually.</p>
