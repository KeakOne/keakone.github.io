        <em>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</em>
        <p>One of my previous tutors in another school was very very skilled and knowledgable, but was not a very compassionate  leader, in the sense that almost all of the other students in the class felt that he was intimidating, and found it hard to reach out to him.

         Thinking back to this situation, It would have been an amazing thing if i had approached him at the right time and let him know in a compassionate way how people are feeling are reacting to him, and how in the long run it only hinders him being a great teacher and his students from learning the most from his vast knowledge. </p>

        <em> Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</em>
        <p>The multiplying goodness meditation is very similiar to what my mother used to make me do as a very young child when i was upset or angry, she would make me breathe all the "bad air" in from the room and breathe out "happy air". Thinking about it, it does sound silly, but it is almost an exact copy of the multiplying goodness meditation.</p>

        <em>Do the tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</em>
        <p>I really enjoyed the tonglen meditation as an extension of the multiplying goodness practise. Since i read this whole chapter through, then doing the practises afterwards, it occured to me it would make sense done this way. I also found doing the multiplying goodness meditation a good "warm-up" to the slightly harder tonglen meditation.</p>

        <em>How does the SCARF model apply to your phase-0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</em>
        <p>The scarf model applies to me in that it was initiated during phaso-0. a lot of the social concepts were new to me, but the evidence is overwhleming that by continuing to practise the excercises it will help me succeed, nd help others succeed during bootcamp.

        I feel that phase-0 has been the initial meditation to be by myself and reflect, and re-purpose myself for happiness. now that I have done that, entering bootcamp is the harder part; applying these thoughts, meditations and social behaviours to daily life, while also learning an incredible amount in a very short space of time. <p>

        <em>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</em>
        <p>Having a difficult conversation was, well, difficult. It's hard to describe the conversation and setting, but something i did notice is that the most challenging part is empathy for me. its quite hard for me to place myself in another persons shoes, while also talking to them and trying to formulate a "difficult" converation. As i did this conversation after prastising the meditation techniques, i found myself listening a lot more than i normally would.</p>
