        <em>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens? </em>
        <p>The idea of applying 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens means to use higher purpose and personal passion related goals, over the more common 'pleasure' goals. an example would be instead of using money as an incentive for wanting to improve your coding skills, make your goal to be a small but important part of your larger plan for life! My personal impossible-possible goal is to be travelling all year round, to be able to achieve that I'm going to have to become amazing at communication as well as learning coding skills.</p>

        <em>What are your core values?</em>
        <p>During the journaling excercise, the value that most commonly showed up was family and career/life control. I wanted to be able to support family members more easily through my own work, and also enjoy creating and working on projects i truly enjoy and am passionate about and not feel stuck in a career. I would love to get to the point where i lead a healthy balance between work and life. </p>

        <em>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</em>
        <p>Focusing on a time of failure made my body feel a lot more frozen and breathing was quicker, and while i was thinking of a time of success i could breathe deeply and clearly, and felt like i was sitting in a better stance naturally. I like this excercise as it made me realise that failure and success are not mutually exclusive, and that you can quickly go from one to the other ina  short amount of time, you dont need to be hung up on failure, or expect continued success.</p>
