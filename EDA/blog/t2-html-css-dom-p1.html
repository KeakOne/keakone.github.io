   <h2><em>design/features i would like to incorporate</em></h2>

  <ul>
    <li>a nav on the side that has a list of my blog entries.</li>
    <li>a simple header with a box logo and the current time</li>
    <li>if i can make it responsive, using a series of boxes taht fit together in different shapes could be fun.</li>
    <li> a suitable background that can be repeated</li>
    <li> follows the simple rule of thirds: header, main content, footer.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2><em>What is the DOM? is there a good analogy to explain it?</em></h2>

  <p>When i was first taught about relationships between the DOM, css, html + js,  my tutor often referanced a cake; with the HTML being the dough, the icing being the css, and the special jelly/caramel/marshmellow exciting part is the JS, the DOM is sort of like the plate its served on and the knife and fork. After looking online i found the most common analogy is the human body.</p>

  <h2><em>What is meant by "boxifying" design?</em></h2>

  <p>Boxifying design is to break a design down into boxes, to make it easier to recreate using widths, percentages or other measurements used when creating a layout.</p>

  <p> for example, if you have a webpage where half the page is an image and half is text, that is one very large box, with two box sharing the width of it sitting side by side.</p>

  <h2><em>What is the box model?</em></h2>

  <p>the box model works hand-in-hand with boxifying design, as it is applied to all HTML elements and determines there position. their is three layers applied to all elements that have their own set of rules and sizes.</p>

  <p>at the very centre is the content itself, whether thats an image text or anything else. the next layer is called padding, then border, then margin. you can change these sizes to control positioning.</p>
