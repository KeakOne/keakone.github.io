          <h5><em>How does Javascript compare to HTML or CSS?</em></h5>
          <p> The main difference is that Javascript is a programming language, while HTML & CSS are more visual building blocks and markup tools for defining and styling your content. Javascript can be used to create a much wider range of web content, whether it is mathematical, visual, interactive etc. Javascript is probably the most common "client-side" framework, meaning that it runs on the users browser of choice.</p>

          <h5><em>Explain control flow and loops using an example from everyday life</em></h5>
          <p>
          control flow is using statements in your code to "manage" the flow or direction it is heading. so if you executed a set of statements only if some condition is met (for example, "age must be 18 to enter this site"), if the user clicks "no" it will trigger one option, and reject the user from entering the site. if the user clicks "yes" the other option will run, and the user will be taken to the homepage of the website. Their could be a third option, that rejects the user if they do not select an option within 1 minute.

          An example from everyday life would be reacting to the weather. lets say we only have two different types of weather in the world, "Raining" and "Sunny". Depending on which of those two the weather is, We either put on more clothes or wear less clothes.</p>

          <h5><em>What is the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals?</em></h5>
          <p>The difference is in the way we access the data. When we access object literals you can either use dot-notation, or bracket-notation. When we access arrays, we use an index that starts at 0, and we place the desired the number of the item we wish to use in-netween brackets [2] </p>

          <h5><em>What are functions and why are they useful??</em></h5>
          <p>Functions are pieces of code that do a specific job. although the data that is parsed into the function can sometimes change, the same function will be performed everytime. if you have an online form, and the user enters their date of birth, you can write a simple function that will subtract their individual date of birth from the current year and give them their age! 

          Although lots of people will have different ages, it will always perform that same task.
