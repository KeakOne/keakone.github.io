  <h2><em>What is grid based design?</em></h2>

  <p>Grid based design is breaking a designed web-page into rows and columns to make it easier to re-create on-screen. The page will be divided into an equal amount of columns that take up the same width, and these columns form rows that stretch 100% of the document.</p>

  <p>by allotting elements more or less of a percent of the columns, you can fit elements around each other evenly, with a nice amount of negative space. </p>

  <h2><em>What's all the hype about 'responsive' design?</em></h2>

  <p>Responsive design plays a huge part in modern web design. More and more people are accessing content via different screen resolutions. Think of all the different screen sizes of laptops, cell phones, tablets, netbooks, televisions etc.. all these sizes interpret the same code and present them on the screen.</p>

  <p>Responsive design is the soloution to most of this problem, where by the front-end designer works in percentages to account for adjustments in screen size. for example, when you are viewing a website on your desktop and the site has a video that automatically plays, this same website will make the video dissapear for smaller screens such as cell phones.</p>

  <h2><em>Semantic structure</em></h2>

  <p>Semantic structure is used in HTML to give MEANING to the content. you "markup" the parts of your HTML documents e.g head , body, h1-h6, footer.once you have given these elements semantic structure, it gives them behaviour and rules when interpreted by the DOM. In short, Semantic structure "outlines" the "meaning" of the elements youve chosen to include. </p>

  <h2><em>Any other thoughts?</em></h2>

  <p>It was useful to be reminded of flexbox. I personally use foundation framework, but it was great to be reminded that i dont need to be using it, and that advances in flexbox and flex-wrap have made it so much easier to create frameworks yourself.</p>
