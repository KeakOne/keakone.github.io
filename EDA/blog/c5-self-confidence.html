          <h5><em>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</em></h5>
          <p> The two are very very similiar, and work together in a complimentary way. By practising mindfullness meditation, and being able to actively use self-awareness to monitor our own bodies and emotions for distrurbances, we can essentially learn to calm ourselves of any emotions. The quote below sums it up muc better than I could

          “The traditional analogy of this mind is a fluttering flag on a flagpole. The flag represents the mind. In the presence of strong emotions, the mind may be turbulent like a flag fluttering violently in the wind. The flagpole represents mindfulness—it keeps the mind steady and grounded despite all that emotional movement. This stability is what allows us to view ourselves with third-person objectivity”

          <h5><em>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</em></h5>
          <p>I've practised using Body scan three times since reading about it in chapter 4, and everytime it has been a more positive experience. At the beginning it was hard to even attempt to "feel" individual parts of my body isolated, but by the third time i started to be able to notice parts of my face feeling isolated from each other, and i could feel the tension and stress inside of my bones(sounds odd!)</p>

          <p>Doing body scans and breathing excercises has helped me to not hold onto stress, even though i find myself worrying about small things (js-racer!!), its helped me to not have those moments of stress carry on.</p>

          <h5><em> What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not me" section?</em></h5>
          <p>This section sort-of confirmed my beliefs that the most important thing for me experiancing and trying the SIY program will be the ability to monitor myself and allow emotions to pass through me rather than consume my entire being. the Metaphor used in the chapter is very spot on;</p>

          <p>“Thoughts and emotions are like clouds—some beautiful, some dark—while our core being is like the sky. Clouds are not the sky; they are phenomena in the sky that come and go.” </p>
