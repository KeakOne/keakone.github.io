          <p>The best and most recent example of getting blocked would be working on this weeks js-racer assignment. I was blocked for two days leading up to friday, and could not find a sensible way to make the movement only apply to certain keys.I spent most of the time trying to solve it by console.logging, and reading errors, however this did not help as much as normal, I think due to my unfamiliarity with Javascript so i could not correctly understand the errors.The block was solved by going into campus and working with other cohort members, as well as getting important help from the present coach Mix. I learnt that its a lot easier to ask for help than i thought!</p>

          <em>I've decided to order the problem solving techniques by how confident, and also how often I use them:</em>
          <ol>
           <li>Console.logging</li>
           <li>Reading error messages</li>
           <li>Googling</li>
           <li>Trying something</li>
           <li>Psuedocode</li>
           <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
           <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
           <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
           <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
          </ol>
            <p> In the past I most often used console logging and reading errors, and combining reading errors with googling so I can try to understand anything the errors are talking about that I dont understand. I feel confident and am used to using these ways, so I am going to endeavor to try to use the other problem solving techniques. </p>

            <p>Since learning about pseudocoding I've found it useful as a way to break down functions, or the order of programming in Javascript. The way I solved my block with the javascript-racer this week was by finding othr cohorts who were free and sharing what we had all done, and by running it all past the EDA coach once we've tried our best independantly.</p>

          <ul>
              <li>.map()</li>
              <li>.filter()</li>
              <li>.reduce()</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>map()</h5>
          <p>after reading about the map() array method, from what i could understand it is used to grab an array, and perform a test or function to each item within that array, and then places them in a new array wit the result. The way i exlained this to my friend is: 

          an array is like a box that holds information,and the map thing is moving the information around. so if we have a box of uncut apples, the map method will take the apples in that box, cut them, put them in a new box labelled "cut apples". </p>

          <h5>filter()</h5>
          <p>The filter method is pretty similiar to using map() from the examples i looked at, the main difference is that it tests the outcome before adding it to the new array. the way i explained this to my flatmate was:

          its pretty much the same as how the apples were sorted before, except pretend you want to check the apples after youve cut them to make sure they havnt got any bruises(i dont know why). This time the filter method will take the apples from one box, cut them, and then before putting them in a new apple box it will check for worms. if worms are found it doesnt add the apple to the new box.
          </p>

          <h5>reduce()</h5>
          <p>The reduce array method I found the hardest to understand, so i was not too sure that I was explaining it correctly...from what I can understand it takes the items inside of an array, and adds them together to reduce the array to one number that is representitive of the array. so if your array contained [1,2,3] after running the reduce method on it the array produced would be [6], because that is the single number that is all the values added together.</p>
