          <h5><em>What did you learn from the 'mindfullness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</em></h5>
          <p>I found the mindfulness conversation quite hard the first 2 times i tried it, it was hard to be able to not break the silence, or try to respond beyond just one word acknowledgements. I did find it a lot easier to listen than to be the one talking. I also found that if i tried my best to keep my mind focused on the other persons mouth, and the sound of their voice and tried to push my own thoughts to the back of my mind I found myself being able to more deeply understand their choice of words and the emotions behind what they were saying.</p>

          <p>The other persons opinion varied between my 3 flatmates, but the thing that was in common was that by mindfully listening, the person telling the story felt that the listener was processing the story completely, and reflecting on it in real-time, rather than just hearing it and immediatly acting on the impulse to talk.</p>

          <h5><em>Which of the three techniques described will you use to sustain your practice?</em></h5>
          <p>I will definatly use walking meditation, as I walk for my main form of transport. I've found that listening to sounds and trying to "un-crowd" the sounds, and accept the mess of noise while still moving and focusing on my breathing has helped me not dwell on stress, and be excited for upcoming challenges rather than nervous of them.</p>

          <h5><em>Any other musings?</em></h5>
          <p>I've noticed their is a difference between the video & correlating book chapters, so from now on I have decided to use the book chapters as I find them more in-depth.</p>
