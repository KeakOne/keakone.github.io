  <em>What timebox and habit techniques did you try?</em>
  <p>I tried the Pomodoro technique, and also read a lot on starting with small changes to make better habits easier to automate.</p>

  <em>What did you find interesting?</em>
  <p>I found the first article on meditation interesting. I have not looked into meditation, but lots of my family use meditation. I also liked the idea of "making it big by starting small"</p>

  <em>what worked for you?</em>
  <p>Aspects of the pomodoro technique worked for me, especially with having set-times for breaks.</p>

  <em>which will you experiment further with?</em>
  <p>No, I knew before enrolling EDA had a very different education style & workflow.</p>
