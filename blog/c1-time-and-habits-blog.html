  <em>What timebox and habit techniques did you try?</em>
  <p>I tried the Pomodoro technique, and also read a lot on starting with small changes to make better habits easier to automate.</p>

  <em>What did you find interesting?</em>
  <p>I found the first article on meditation interesting. I have not looked into meditation, but lots of my family use meditation. I also liked the idea of "making it big by starting small". A few of the tips from the "counterintuitive tips" article stood out to me as well, particurlarly #4 that emphasised changing your approach.</p>

  <em>what worked for you?</em>
  <p>Aspects of the pomodoro technique worked for me, especially with having set-times for breaks. I tend to dive straight into objectives, so stepping back and approaching things from a different perspective was useful</p>

  <em>which will you experiment further with?</em>
  <p>I will experiment more with the pomodoro technique, i've found working in 30 min intervals works well for me. I also want to try starting micro with objectives im put off by, e.g doing 2 minutes of a task just to get the ball rolling and start momentum.</p>
